\begin{abstract}
\noindent This document briefly describes what are structural models in Economics. It distinguishes structural and non-structural estimation as approaches that enable to answer different research questions. Also, it discusses parametric and non-parametric assumptions as auxiliary means that help to recover parameters that enable to answer these research questions. The document builds on \citet{keane2011structural}. The difference between this document and that paper is that this document intends to be more concrete and schematic about how the modeling approaches behave, it skips the least algebra steps in all the derivations, and it provides practical examples. Also, it provides extra exercises that teach basic tools of Computational Econometrics.
