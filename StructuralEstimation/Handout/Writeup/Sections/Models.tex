\section{Model Classifications, Estimation Strategies, and Research Goals} \label{section:models}
In this section we consider the static model in \citet{keane2011structural} to illustrate how different modeling approaches and estimation strategies enable to attain the research goals in Section \ref{section:extension}.
\subsection{Woman's Labor Force Participation} \label{section:model}
Consider the following model of the labor force participation of a married woman. The model is unitary and the couple's $i$ utility at time $t$ is
\begin{equation}
U_{it} = U \left( c_{it}, 1-d_{it}; n_{it}(1-d_{it}), \kappa_{it}(1-d_{it}), \epsilon_{it} (1-d_{it}) \right) \label{eq:utility}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $c_{it}$ is consumption, $d_{it}$ is an indicator of the woman's labor supply ($1$ if she works and $0$ if she does not), $n_{it}$ is the number of young children that the couple has, $\kappa_{it}$ and $\epsilon_{it}$ are observed and unobserved factors that shift the couple's valuation of home production. Actually, $t$ corresponds to the couple's marriage duration. The utility function satisfies standard concavity and Inada conditions.\\
\indent The wife receives a wage offer $w_{it}$ in each period $t$ and the husband, who works every period, receives an income $y_{it}$. If the wife works, the family needs to pay child care, $\pi$ for each child in each period. Hence, the budget constraint is
\begin{equation}
c_{it} = y_{it} + w_{it} d_{it} - \pi n_{it} d_{it} \label{eq:budget}.
\end{equation}

\indent In this simple model, a wage function determines the wage offer that women receive:
\begin{equation}
w_{it} = w(z_{it}, \eta_{it}) \label{eq:wage}
\end{equation} 

\noindent where $z_{it}$ are observed and $\eta_{it}$ unobserved factors. By assumption, $\epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it}$ are not serially correlated between each other.

\begin{exercise}
Is this model static or dynamic?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What are the variables that you expect to find in $z_{it}$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Why is no serial correlation between $\epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it}$ a relevant assumption? Is it a technical or an economic assumption? Is it realistic? Hint: go ahead and answer the reminder of the exercise and then come back to this question.
\end{exercise}

\indent This structure, actually, is enough to describe the problem through a decision rule that a latent variable dictates, as in (\ref{eq:latent}). Specifically, substitute (\ref{eq:budget}),(\ref{eq:wage}) into (\ref{eq:utility}) and note that
\begin{eqnarray}
d_{it} =
\begin{cases}
1 \  \text{if }  v_{it}^* \left( y_{it}, z_{it}, n_{it}, \kappa_{it}, \epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it} \right) \ \geq 0  \\
0 \  \text{if }  v_{it}^* \left( y_{it}, z_{it}, n_{it}, \kappa_{it}, \epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it} \right)  < 0 \label{eq:latent2}
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
where $v_{it}^* \left( y_{it}, z_{it}, n_{it}, \kappa_{it}, \epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it} \right) \equiv U_{it}^1 - U_{it}^0$ and
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{it}^1 &=& U(y_{it} + w_{it}(z_{it}, \eta_{it}) - \pi n_{it}, 0) \\
U_{it}^0 &=& U(y_{it}, 1; n_{it}, \kappa_{it}, \epsilon_{it}).
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{definition} (The State Space)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Household State Space: $\Omega_{it} = \{ y_{it}, z_{it}, n_{it}, \kappa_{it}, \epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it} \}$.
\item Observed Household State Space: $\Omega_{it}^- = \{ y_{it}, z_{it}, n_{it}, \kappa_{it} \}$.
\item The set of values of the unobserved variables that makes a household with observed state space $\Omega_{it}^-$ choose $d_{it} = 1$: $S \left(  \Omega_{it}^- \right) = \{ \epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it}:  v^* \left(\epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it} ; \Omega_{it}^- \right) \geq 0 \}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\indent This enables to write
\begin{eqnarray}
\Pr \left( d_{it} = 1 | \Omega_{it}^{-} \right) &=& \int \limits _{S \left(  \Omega_{it}^- \right)} d F _{\epsilon, \eta |  y, \kappa, z, n} \nonumber \\
&=& G \left( y_{it}, z_{it}, n_{it}, \kappa_{it} \right).
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Obviously, $\Pr \left( d_{it} = 0 | \Omega_{it}^- \right) = 1 - \Pr \left( d_{it} = 1 | \Omega_{it}^- \right)$. The main components of $G \left( y, \kappa, z, n \right)$ are $U(\cdot), w(\cdot), F _{\epsilon, \eta,  y, \kappa, z, n}$, which conform the \emph{structure} or the \emph{set of primitives} of the model. Consider the following definitions of estimation approaches and auxiliary assumptions.

\begin{definition} (Estimation Approaches) \label{definition:ea}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Structural (S): it recovers some or all of the parameters of that define the structure of the model.
\item Non-Structural (NS): it recovers $G(\cdot)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} (Auxiliary Assumptions for Identification) \label{definition:aa}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parametric (P): assumes parametric forms about the structure of the model or about $G(\cdot)$.
\item Non-Parametric (NP): it does not impose parametric forms on either the structure or $G(\cdot)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\indent The combination of the initial approaches and the two auxiliary assumptions for identifications leads to a total of four possible estimation approaches: (i) S-P; (ii) S-NP; (iii) NS-P; (iv) NS-NP. The relevant question to ask is which of the estimation approaches enable to attain the research goals in Section \ref{section:extension}.

\begin{exercise} (The Joint Distribution of Observed and Unobserved Variables)
Give a sufficient condition on the joint distribution of observed and unobserved variables to attain each of the research goals in Section \ref{section:extension}. Hint: Think if you can ask the questions implied by the research goals without an assumption about the relation between the unobserved variables that affect preferences and the wage function and the observed variables. Then, make a simple assumption about the joint distribution of the observed and unobserved variables.
\end{exercise}

\indent This model enables to illustrate how different estimation approaches help to attain the different research goals in Section \ref{section:extension}. Consider the following examples:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Goal 1: from (\ref{eq:utility}) note that an increase in wage increases the utility the household has if the woman works and does not affect the utility the household has when the woman does not work. Then, a test of the theory is to analyze if the probability of woman's employment is increasing in wage. 
\item Goal 2: take the derivative of $G(\cdot)$, the probability of woman's employment, with respect to any of the state variables.
\item Goal 3: take the derivative of $G(\cdot)$, the probability of woman's employment, with respect to a variable that is outside the model (e.g., $\pi$, the per-child cost of child-care). 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise} (Estimation Approaches and Research Goals) \label{exercise:approaches}
What research goals can you attain with the estimation approaches NP-NS, P-NS, P-NS. Be as formal as possible. Hint: think of the different effects that you are able to identify.
\begin{itemize}
\item NP-NS: the base of this approach is a non-parametric estimate of $G(\cdot)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal 1: the typical example of an exercise towards Goal 1 is to inspect how a change in the wage affects the woman's labor force participation decision. An important feature of this model is that wages are observed iff the woman participates of the labor market. This shapes the possibility to answer research questions related to Goal 1. This exercise requires variation in $w_{it}$ that is independent to variation in other variables that determine participation. Put differently, the exercise requires a variable in $z_{it}$ which is not in $\kappa_{it}$ (an exclusion restriction). Also, it is necessary to sign the effect of the exclusion restriction on the wage. This follows because $w_{it}$ enters indirectly into the latent function, through $z_{it}$. Again, the reason of this is that the wages are not observed for everyone.   
\item Goal 2: it is possible to obtain a non-parametric estimate of $G(\cdot)$ (think of a empirical c.d.f.). This enables to test the change of any of the variables on participation \emph{within the range of the data}. Since the estimate is non-parametric, it is impossible to make out-of-sample tests.   
\item Goal 3: a natural research question towards this goal is to study what happens when $\pi$ changes. It is impossible to identify $\pi$ from $G(\cdot)$, however. Note that $G_{n} = \pi G_{n \pi}$. Thus, it is not possible to identify $\pi$ from $G_{n \pi}$ and carry on with the exercise.
\end{itemize} 
\item P-NS: the base of this approach is a parametric assumption about $G(\cdot)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal 1: by the same reasoning as in the NP-NS approach this requires an exclusion restriction. This is simply because a parametric assumption does not imply that the effects through $z_{it}$ and $\kappa_{it}$ without an exclusion restriction. 
\item Goal 2: the parametric assumption on $G(\cdot)$ enables to test the change of any of the variables on participation \emph{within and outside the range of the data}.
\item Goal 3: again, it is impossible to identify $\pi$ from $G(\cdot)$.
\end{itemize}
\item NP-S: this approach is not feasible because it implies to identify $U(\cdot), w(\cdot), F$ without any parametric or auxiliary assumptions and the wages for the women who do not work are not observed for everyone. When the wages are observed for everyone the structure is reduced and some normalizations enable to identify it \citep[see][]{matzkin1993nonparametric}.
\item P-S: see Exercise \ref{exercise:psapproach}.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Estimation of a Parametric, Structural Model}
In this exercise you will take a S-P approach to estimate the model in Section \ref{section:model}. Of course, there are many variations of parametric assumptions that you can impose. We guide you and you estimate. Various exercises lead to the final answer. 

\begin{assumption} (Utility and Wage Functions and the Joint Distribution of Unobserved Variables) \label{assumption:utwajo}
The utility function is:
\begin{equation}
U_{it} = c_{it} + \alpha_{it} (1 - d_{it})
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\alpha_{it} = \beta_{\kappa} \kappa_{it} + \beta_{n} n_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$ and $\beta_{\kappa},\beta_{n}$ are scalars. The wage function is:
\begin{equation}
w_{it} = z_{it} \gamma + \eta_{it}.
\end{equation}
\noindent The distribution of unobserved variables is
\begin{equation}
f \left( \epsilon_{it}, \eta_{it} \right) \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \Lambda \right)
\end{equation}
where $\left( \begin{array}{cc} 
\sigma_{\epsilon}^2 & \cdot \\
\sigma_{\epsilon, \eta} & \sigma_{\eta}^2
\end{array} \right)$.  
\end{assumption}

\begin{exercise} (Wage Normality)
Is it odd to model the shock to wages as normal? Why is it useful? 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (The State Space)
Define $\Omega_{it}$ and $\Omega_{it}^-$ for this problem. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Latent Variable Function)
Use Assumption \ref{assumption:utwajo} to write down the latent variable function. First define $U_{it}^1$ and $U_{it}^0$. Your latent function should be a function of $\xi_{it} \equiv \eta_{it} - \epsilon_{it}$ and  $\xi_{it}^*\left( \Omega_{it}^- \right) \equiv z_{it} \gamma - \left( \pi \beta_{n} \right) - \kappa_{it} \beta_{\kappa}$. Use this notation for the rest of the problem.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Individual and Sample Likelihood Function)
Write down the individual likelihood that individual $i$ at time $t$ contributes to the sample likelihood function. Write down the sample likelihood function.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Estimands and Identification) \label{exercise:estimands}
What is the set of parameters that you want to estimate? Are all of these parameters identified? Hint: read \citet{heckman1979sample}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Simulation) \label{exercise:simulations}
Simulate a strongly balanced data set with $n = 1000$ observations and $T=3$. Use the following parameters: $\beta_\kappa = 0.5, \beta_n = 0.2, \sigma_\epsilon = 1, \pi = 0.2, \gamma_1 = 0.8, \sigma_\eta = 0.2, \sigma_{\epsilon \eta} = 0.3$. Assume that $y_{it} \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{U} (0,10)$. $\kappa_{it}$, $z_{it}$ and $n_{it}$ are time invariant. In particular, $\kappa_{i}, z_{i} \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{U} (0,5)$, and $n_{i}$ follows a discrete uniform distribution and $n_{i} \in \left\{0,1,2,3\right\}$. Use the Numpy random package in Python and set the seed to zero.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Estimation)
Estimate the parameters of the model by ML. Compare your results with the parameters in Exercise \ref{exercise:simulations}. Hint: if the BFGS algorithm does not work use the Nelder-Mead algorithm.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{exercise:psapproach}
What research goals are you able to attain with this approach?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Think of three policy questions that you can address with each of estimation of the model you just did. You need to link each question to each research goal in Section \ref{section:extension}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What are you able to learn from each estimation approach? Is any estimation approach better than the other? Why?
\end{exercise}
