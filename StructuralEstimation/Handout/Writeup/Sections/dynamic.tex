\section{Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming}
Consider the dynamic version of the model in Section \ref{section:model}. The utility function, the budget constraint, and the distribution of the unobserved variables are the same. The dynamics of the model come through the wage process. In particular, $w_{it}$ increases with work experience, $h_{it}$. This equals the total number of periods that the woman in household $i$ accumulates in all the periods previous to $t$:
\begin{equation}
h_{it} = \sum\limits_{\tau=1}^{t-1} d_{i\tau},
\end{equation} 
\noindent where $h_{i1} = 0$ for simplicity. The wage function is
\begin{equation}
w_{it} = z_{i}\gamma_{1} + \gamma_{2}h_{it} + \eta_{it}.
\end{equation} 

\noindent For simplicity, the variables $\kappa_{it}$, $n_{it}$, $z_{it}$ are non-stochastic and time invariant.

\begin{exercise} (Dynamic Programming Set-up)
Write down the household's problem for each period $t$. Let $\delta$ be the discount factor, $\Omega_{it}$ the state space, and $\Omega_{it}^-$ the observed state space. Write down the elements in $\Omega_{it},\Omega_{it}^-$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Solution)
Solve the dynamic problem of the household for for an arbitrary time horizon, $T$. Hint: use a backward recursion.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Simulation and Estimation}

\begin{exercise} (Likelihood)
What is the individual likelihood of household $i$ at time $t$? What is the sample likelihood across all periods?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Simulation) \label{exercise:simulation}
Simulate a balanced data set with $N = 1000$ observations and $T=6$. Use the same parameters as in the static model in Section \ref{section:models}. For the parameters that are exclusive of the dynamic model use the following: $\gamma_2 = 0.9,\delta = 0.85$. Set the experience of every woman to zero in $t=1$. Save the data in a ``.csv'' file.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Estimation)
Estimate the parameters of the model by ML. Compare your results with the parameters in Exercise \ref{exercise:simulation}.
